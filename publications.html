Available at:<a class = "projects" href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bdm.2187#pane-pcw-references"> https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bdm.2187#pane-pcw-references </a></p>

  <p style="font-size:13px;"> We study the psychology at the intersection of two social trends. First, as markets become increasingly specialized, consumers must increasingly defer to outside experts to decide among complex products. Second, people divide themselves increasingly into moral tribes, defining themselves in terms of shared values with their group and often seeing these values as being objectively right or wrong. We tested how and why these tribalistic tendencies affect consumers' willingness to defer to experts. We find that consumers are indeed tribalistic in which experts they find convincing, preferring products advocated by experts who share their moral values (Study 1), with this effect generalizing across product categories (books and electronics) and measures (purchase intentions, information‐seeking, willingness‐to‐pay, product attitudes, and consequential choices). We also establish the mechanisms underlying these effects: because many consumers believe moral matters to be objective facts, experts who disagree with those values are seen as less competent and therefore less believable (Studies 2 and 3), with this effect strongest among consumers who are high in their belief in objective moral truth (Study 4). Overall, these studies seek not only to establish dynamics of tribalistic deference to experts but also to identify which consumers are more or less likely to fall prey to these tribalistic tendencies.</p>

        <p style="font-size:13px;"> People assess others’ moral characters to predict what they will do. Here, we study the computational mechanisms used to predict behavior from uncertain evidence about character. Whereas previous work has found that people often ignore hypotheses with low probabilities, we find that people often account for the possibility of poor moral character even when that possibility is relatively unlikely. There was no evidence that comparable inferences from uncertain non-moralized traits integrate across multiple possibilities. These results contribute to our understanding of moral judgment, probability reasoning, and theory of mind.</p>

   <p style="font-size:13px;">COVID-19 has impacted transportation worldwide with public transportation seeing some of the largest decreases. This paper focuses on the impact that COVID-19 has had on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) public train transportation in Chicago. We break down the overall ridership into segments based on the associated income levels of neighborhoods near each CTA train station. We explore geospatial, temporal, and correlational relationships between daily ridership and median household income levels for all of Chicago during the COVID-19 pandemic. Temporal patterns across income groups were similar but decreases in ridership were much larger in higher income areas. Median income acted as a strong predictor of ridership changes when delineating disparate income groups but becomes weaker when viewing correlations within income groups, especially among the wealthiest riders. This indicates income acts as a strong predictor of ridership but becomes weaker as ridership behavior becomes homogenous beyond a certain income level.
