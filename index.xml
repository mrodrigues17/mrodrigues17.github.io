      <title>Navigating Uncertainty with Bayesian Statistics</title>

      <description>Picture this: you just woke up, and as you go about your morning routine, the question lingers – will it rain today, and should you grab an umbrella? There&amp;rsquo;s a subtle assumption about the likelihood of rain on any given day, but you have the means to fine-tune this probability. Gazing out of your window, you observe the clouds overhead; this observation shifts your initial assumption, tilting it toward a higher chance of rain.</description>

      <title>The Math Behind Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://mrodrigues17.github.io/blog/linear_regression/</link>

      <description>Despite its simplicity, linear regression is one of the most ubiquitous machine learning algorithms used today. Linear regression often ends up being a better model choice than more complicated ones because linear regression is easy to interpret and complicated models may overfit the data. Even though linear regression is considered simple in the realm of machine learning models, it is easy to treat models as black boxes without understanding the algorithm, and understanding how linear regression actually gets calculated lays the foundation for understanding more complex algorithms.</description>

      <description>Using data taken from IMDb,
 Used data take from IMDb to do feature engineering and create sparse matrices. Using cosine similarity, users select a vector of interest by indicating a movie title they like to get movie titles similar to the title they entered. The user can also specify the number of movies returned. UI file: controls user interface included the ability to select movie titles and the number of recommendations Server file: creates the output for the Shiny application data cleaning file: reads data from IMDb files and performs filtering and feature transformations  Github with UI, Server, and R data cleaning files available here</description>

      <title>Impact of COVID-19 on Public Transportation</title>
      <link>https://mrodrigues17.github.io/publications/chapter-3/</link>

      <description>COVID-19 has dramatically impacted transportation worldwide with public transportation seeing some of the largest decreases. This paper focuses on the impact that COVID-19 has had on Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) public train transportation in Chicago. We break down the overall ridership into segments based on the associated income levels of neighborhoods near each CTA train station. While ridership reduction stems from individual risk mitigation decision-making, government policy influences behavior to some extent.</description>

      <title>Moral tribalism and its discontents: How intuitive theories of ethics shape consumers&#39; deference to experts</title>
      <link>https://mrodrigues17.github.io/publications/chapter-1/</link>

      <description>We study the psychology at the intersection of two social trends. First, as markets become increasingly specialized, consumers must increasingly defer to outside experts to decide among complex products. Second, people divide themselves increasingly into moral tribes, defining themselves in terms of shared values with their group and often seeing these values as being objectively right or wrong. We tested how and why these tribalistic tendencies affect consumers&#39; willingness to defer to experts.</description>

      <title>Predictions from Uncertain Moral Character</title>
      <link>https://mrodrigues17.github.io/publications/chapter-2/</link>

      <description>People assess others’ moral characters to predict what they will do. Here, we study the computational mechanisms used to predict behavior from uncertain evidence about character. Whereas previous work has found that people often ignore hypotheses with low probabilities, we find that people often account for the possibility of poor moral character even when that possibility is relatively unlikely. There was no evidence that comparable inferences from uncertain non-moralized traits integrate across multiple possibilities.</description>

      <description>Police Killings Visualized The application shows police killing trends over the last few years (data collection began in 2015 by the Washington Post). Data is pulled directly from the Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s Github.
R code combines data from the US Census Bureau, application available here</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms Without Python ML Packages on a Binary Classification Task</title>

      <description>For these projects, I am going to walk through the steps I went through in writing different algorithms for a binary classification task. Data cleaning and feature engineering steps aren&amp;rsquo;t included, these steps are just covering the algorithm. Below is a table showing the feature engineered, normalized data the algorithms are applied to: it is the introductory machine learning challenge dataset from Kaggle where features from Titanic ticket stubs are used to predict if a passenger died or survived the disaster.</description>
