      <title>Moral tribalism and its discontents: How intuitive theories of ethics shape consumers&#39; deference to experts</title>

      <description>We study the psychology at the intersection of two social trends. First, as markets become increasingly specialized, consumers must increasingly defer to outside experts to decide among complex products. Second, people divide themselves increasingly into moral tribes, defining themselves in terms of shared values with their group and often seeing these values as being objectively right or wrong. We tested how and why these tribalistic tendencies affect consumers&#39; willingness to defer to experts.</description>

      <description>Used data take from IMDb to do feature engineering and create sparse matrices. Using cosine similarity, users select a vector of interest by indicating a movie title they like to get movie titles similar to the title they entered. The user can also specify the number of movies returned. UI file: controls user interface included the ability to select movie titles and the number of recommendations Server file: creates the output for the Shiny application data cleaning file: reads data from IMDb files and performs filtering and feature transformations  Github with UI, Server, and R data cleaning files available here</description>

      <title>Predictions from Uncertain Moral Character</title>

      <description>People assess others’ moral characters to predict what they will do. Here, we study the computational mechanisms used to predict behavior from uncertain evidence about character. Whereas previous work has found that people often ignore hypotheses with low probabilities, we find that people often account for the possibility of poor moral character even when that possibility is relatively unlikely. There was no evidence that comparable inferences from uncertain non-moralized traits integrate across multiple possibilities.</description>

      <description>Police Killings Visualized The application shows police killing trends over the last few years (data collection began in 2015 by the Washington Post). Data is pulled directly from the Washington Post&amp;rsquo;s Github.
R code combines data from the US Census Bureau, application available here</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Algorithms Without Python ML Packages on a Binary Classification Task</title>

      <description>For these projects, I am going to walk through the steps I went through in writing different algorithms for a binary classification task. Data cleaning and feature engineering steps aren&amp;rsquo;t included, these steps are just covering the algorithm. Below is a table showing the feature engineered, normalized data the algorithms are applied to: it is the introductory machine learning challenge dataset from Kaggle where features from Titanic ticket stubs are used to predict if a passenger died or survived the disaster.</description>

      <description>We are delighted to be able to inform the reader, that during the whole of this scene, Gringoire and his piece had stood firm. His actors, spurred on by him, had not ceased to spout his comedy, and he had not ceased to listen to it. He had made up his mind about the tumult, and was determined to proceed to the end, not giving up the hope of a return of attention on the part of the public.</description>

      <description>In the twinkling of an eye, all was ready to execute Coppenole’s idea. Bourgeois, scholars and law clerks all set to work. The little chapel situated opposite the marble table was selected for the scene of the grinning match. A pane broken in the pretty rose window above the door, left free a circle of stone through which it was agreed that the competitors should thrust their heads. In order to reach it, it was only necessary to mount upon a couple of hogsheads, which had been produced from I know not where, and perched one upon the other, after a fashion.</description>
